# INTPROG Coursework

The coursework was to write a program to display given patchwork samples.

The assessment was marked out of 40 and was worth 20% of the marks for the module. I scored 39/40 (97.5%) having dropped 1 mark for some repetitive code.
## Features:
- Pressing 'd' deletes the patch
- Pressing 's' switches the patch to the other design, keeping the colour the same (this option
should have no effect for a deleted (empty) patch)
- (only if the space is empty) pressing the key of the initial letter of any valid colour ('r', 'g', 'b', 'm', 'o' or 'p') creates a new patch of the final-digit design with this colour
- the Enter key deselects the patch
- all other keys have no effect

## Requirements:
This project is built against [Zelle's Graphics Library](https://mcsp.wartburg.edu//zelle/python/graphics.py).
